### Summary

This was my first large project using vanilla JavaScript. I continued to practice the use of `if..else` statements, and I implemented `for` loops for the first time in a project. I'm especially proud of being able to use the `reduce()` method to total the value of the cards in the player and dealer hands. This was also the first time I used string interpolation in a project; I dynamically generated the `src` of the card images by interpolating the card face and suit into the `src` file path.

### Project Goals

- [x] Create an app where the user can play hands of blackjack
- [x] Generate a deck of cards using `for` loops
- [x] Using the [Fisher–Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher–Yates_shuffle), shuffle the deck
- [x] Create functions to handle dealing cards, hitting, and staying
- [x] Create logic using `if..else` statements that determines the winner of the hand
- [x] Manipulate DOM elements to display the player's hand, the dealer's hand, and the results of the game
- [x] Make a "Reset Game" button

### Technologies Used
